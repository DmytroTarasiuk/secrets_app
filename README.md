An educational full stack website was created during my backend course.

Secrets application allows you to share your secret online anonimously. It uses session for storing data.

The website has the highest level of security user's passwords and allows you to log in within Google.

Techologies used: **Node.js, express.js,  MongoDB, EJS, HTML, CSS**


To start using locally you will need to:

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install all required packeges (go to the 'packege.json' file and check out 'dependencies' key). Use **npm** packet manager or **yard**.
3.  Using command line run your local sever by typing 'node app.js' or 'nodemon app.js'.
